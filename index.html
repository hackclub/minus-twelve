          <b>Minus Twelve</b> is a <a href="https://ysws.hackclub.com" target="_blank">You Ship, We Ship</a> event about <i>tools.</i>
          <br>
          Use <b>JavaScript</b> or <b>TypeScript</b> to design a useful piece of software, and we'll send you a shiny new <i>microcontroller board</i> to help you design some useful hardware!

        <h2>what's a tool?</h2>
        <p>A <i>tool</i> is something that helps you and other hackers <i>solve a problem</i>. It should be easy for people to use, and it should be usable by lots of different people.</p>
        <p>For this YSWS, you should aim to spend <b>12 hours or less</b> designing your tool. You can spend more time on it if you need to, but the focus is on <i>smaller projects</i> &mdash; it doesn't have to be perfect!</p>
        <p>Consider the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is something I've had to write code for over and over again that can be <i>abstracted</i> to make it easier to do?</li>
          <li>Is there something I've had to do in the past that I can <i>improve</i> by solving a certain problem?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you have an answer for either of these, there's probably a good tool in there somewhere!</p>
        <p>Still stuck? Here are a few examples of great tools:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/sporeball/tentamen" target="_blank">tentamen</a>, which helps you test JavaScript code (by <a href="https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U01G0Q9K998" target="_blank">@lux</a>)</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/pretty-ms" target="_blank">pretty-ms</a>, which helps you make time values look nice (by <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus" target="_blank">@sindresorhus</a>)</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/node-progress" target="_blank">progress</a>, which helps you draw text-based progress bars (by <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia" target="_blank">@visionmedia</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>what do i need to do?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Create a tool.</b>
            <br>
            This must be written in <b>JavaScript</b> or <b>TypeScript</b>, but can do anything you want. <i>Be creative!</i>
            <br>
            It also needs to include a <i>well-written description</i> of how you're supposed to use it. Look at the examples above for ideas!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Make it public.</b>
            <br>
            Your tool must live in a <i>public GitHub repository</i> so that other hackers can find it and look at your code.
            <br>
            It also needs to be published to a JavaScript <i>package manager</i>, such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com" target="_blank">npm</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Tell us about it.</b>
            <br>
            Join <a href="https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C087S82MNFR" target="_blank">#minus-twelve</a> on the Hack Club Slack and tell us about your tool!
            <br>
            If you want to hack on your tool with others, we will also be running <i>two huddles</i> in this channel <i>every two days</i> &mdash; one at <b>12PM EST</b> for US/EU and one at <b>10PM EST</b> for APAC!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Get a microcontroller!</b>
            <br>
            If you finish creating your tool and <a href="https://forms.hackclub.com/t/cqWk12nX7Fus" target="_blank">submit it</a> by <b>January 27, 2024</b> at <b>11:59PM EST</b>, we'll send you a microcontroller to help kickstart your next project!
            <br>
            We might even send some extra accessories, too. Stay tuned...
